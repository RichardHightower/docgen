# FIX RAW RESPONSE 2
# Participants

Here is a list of participants for the sequence diagram:

1. NoArrayRule
2. Relationship
3. RuleResult

# Validation Fixes

Based on the validation issues, here is the plan to fix them:

- Fix the error in the line: `else Parsed relationship is a valid relationship`. There should be a newline after `else` to start a new interaction.
- Correct the indentation in the line: `NoArrayRule->>RuleResult: Return RuleResult.SUCCESS`.

# Interaction After Fix

Here is the corrected list of interactions:

- NoArrayRule->>Relationship: Create Pattern
- NoArrayRule->>Relationship: Check if line has relationship
- alt Parsed relationship is NOT_FOUND
  - NoArrayRule->>RuleResult: Create RuleResult
  - RuleResult-->>NoArrayRule: Returns RuleResult
- else Parsed relationship is a valid relationship
  - NoArrayRule->>Relationship: Parse relationship
  - NoArrayRule->>Relationship: Check for arrays in class
  - alt There are arrays in the left class
    - NoArrayRule->>RuleResult: Create RuleResult
    - RuleResult-->>NoArrayRule: Returns RuleResult
  - else There are no arrays in the left class
    - NoArrayRule->>Relationship: Check for arrays in class
    - alt There are arrays in the right class
      - NoArrayRule->>RuleResult: Create RuleResult
      - RuleResult-->>NoArrayRule: Returns RuleResult
    - else There are no arrays in the right class
      - NoArrayRule->>RuleResult: Return RuleResult.SUCCESS
- end

# Final Participants

Based on the interactions in the sequence, the final list of participants is:

1. NoArrayRule
2. Relationship
3. RuleResult

Please note that I have corrected the issues and generated the corresponding sequence diagram. Let me know if you have any further questions.
