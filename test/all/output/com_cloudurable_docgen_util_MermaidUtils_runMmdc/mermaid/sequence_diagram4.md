# FIX RAW RESPONSE 1
# Participants
The participants for the sequence diagram are as follows:
1. MermaidUtils
2. StringBuilder
3. Latch
4. Service
5. Reader
6. Task
7. Result
8. FileUtils

# Validation Fixes
Going through the validation issues in the validation JSON, here are the planned fixes:
1. Issue: Angle brackets in participants and interactions
   * Fix: Replace angle brackets with ~, e.g., List<Employee> to List~Employee~.

# Interaction After Fix
The interactions after applying the fixes are as follows:
1. MermaidUtils creates StringBuilders for output and error messages.
2. MermaidUtils initializes the latch with a count of 2.
3. MermaidUtils creates a new Service.
4. MermaidUtils executes the command and passes it to Task.
5. Service submits a task to Reader to read the output of the process.
6. Service submits another task to Reader to read the error stream of the process.
7. Task waits for the process to complete.
8. If there is a timeout, MermaidUtils appends a timeout message to the error StringBuilder.
9. MermaidUtils shuts down the Service.
10. Task gets the exit code of the process.
11. If the exit code is not zero, MermaidUtils reads the input file using FileUtils and creates a Result object with the exit code, output StringBuilder, error StringBuilder, and a null exception.
12. If the exit code is zero, MermaidUtils creates a Result object with the exit code, output StringBuilder, error StringBuilder, and a null exception.

# Final Participants
The final participants after applying the fixes and considering only the participants used in the interactions are:
1. MermaidUtils
2. StringBuilder
3. Latch
4. Service
5. Reader
6. Task
7. Result
8. FileUtils

# Plain English Title
The plain English title based on "runMmdc (com.cloudurable.docgen.util.MermaidUtils)" is "Execute Mermaid Command".
