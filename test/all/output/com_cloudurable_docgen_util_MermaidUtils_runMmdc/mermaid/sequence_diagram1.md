# Initial Interactions

1. MermaidUtils receives the `runMmdc` method call with the `input` and `output` files as parameters.
2. MermaidUtils creates the `command` string using the paths of the input and output files.
3. MermaidUtils creates a new ExecutorService.
4. MermaidUtils initializes AtomicReference objects for `output` and `error` StringBuilder instances.
5. MermaidUtils initializes a CountDownLatch with an initial count of 2.
6. MermaidUtils tries to execute the `command` using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec`.
7. ExecutorService submits two tasks:
   - First task: Reads the standard output of the process and appends it to the `output` StringBuilder.
   - Second task: Reads the standard error of the process and appends it to the `error` StringBuilder.
8. MermaidUtils waits for the process to complete by calling `process.waitFor()`.
9. If the CountDownLatch times out, an error message is printed.
10. ExecutorService is shut down.
11. The exit code of the process is checked.
12. A new Result object is created with the exit code, `output` StringBuilder, `error` StringBuilder, and null for the exception.
13. The Result object is returned.
